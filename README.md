# UIDEF: A Real-world Underwater Image Dataset

[TOC]

The *UIDEF* dataset is collected during oceanic explorations and human-robot cooperative experiments in different locations under various visibility conditions. Specifically, we first used two different cameras to record the 640P and 1080P underwater videos. After recording the videos, we sampled images according to the different characteristics (*e.g.*, color, perspective, and scene) from these videos to construct *UIDEF*, which contains a large collection of unpaired and consecutive underwater images with a number of 9200.

We divide the collected images into seven categories: images with distorted color, images with different perspectives, images with low contrast, images with blur perception, images with an uneven-brightness scene, images with a dim scene, and images with a turbid scene. Then, considering the difference in cast color, the images with distorted color are further divided into three subcategories of bluish appearance, greenish appearance, and yellowish appearance. Similarly, the images with different perspectives are further divided into three subcategories of downward-looking, forward-looking, and upward-looking based on the shooting perspective. These images are carefully selected to accommodate a wide range of underwater degradation variability.

This dataset contains three color casts, three captured perspectives, three complex scenes, low contrast due to scattering, and blur perception caused by camera shake, which basically covers the multiple degradation types and different shooting perspectives of common underwater imagery.
